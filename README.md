## General info

> The goal of the home page is to promote Madhu's work and attract clients.  
> Whithin this project I have practiced **Discover & Define phase of the Double Diamond design process**.  
> I started with an interview to define my client, Madhu, to determine what she needs from this home page.  
> Based on the results of that interview, I developed an initial design in Figma.
